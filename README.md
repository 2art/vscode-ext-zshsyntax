# Zsh Syntax (art2.zsh-syntax)

This extension provides syntax highlighting and a custom language identifier for Zsh, so it can be individually configured as per liking in Settings.json.

The syntax file is a very slightly modified standard .tmLanguage file for unix-shell-bash in VSCode's repositories.

There are some plans to add Zsh-specific things for highlighting, and eventually also very basic completion system (possibly, still thinking.)

**Note: This is my first extension, and I have no clue about VSCode extensions, so some things may be done in a non-optimal manner; All criticism is welcome of course!**
